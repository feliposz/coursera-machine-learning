"Machine learning is not magic; it canâ€™t get
something from nothing. What it does is get more from
less. Programming, like all engineering, is a lot of work:
we have to build everything from scratch. Learning is more
like farming, which lets nature do most of the work. Farmers
combine seeds with nutrients to grow crops. Learners
combine knowledge with data to grow programs."
